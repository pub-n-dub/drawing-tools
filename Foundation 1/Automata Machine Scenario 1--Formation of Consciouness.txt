Automata Machine Scenario 1: Initialization
From the Inert to Consciousness
Part of "Foundation 1"
Synopsis: A tasking presented to an entity possessing sensor items or an orchestrated network observing two objects and free to exercise up to four momenta points in an environment.

Scenario:

ME I awake and find myself in darkness (white). 'Empty', I 'think' 'Zero, One, Two, Three, and Four'. 'Search' to the left and the right, I 'find' move A and move B 'A | B'. Search up and down, I find move C and move D 'C | D'. I find 'facilities' sight, sound, touch. I 'see' a scene before me, a long plane extending 'forever': to the left is a blue ball 'floating' and to the right is a red ball 'floating'. Is it a dream?

Explicate:

'Empty' in that as a null item.
(white) as an arbitrary classification of an empty sensor network.
'think' as probing of the compiler architecture and routine structure.
'Zero, One, Two, Three, and Four' in that the degrees of freedom represented in the programming framework [compiler].
'search' as probing hardware registry for a component.
'find' as a successful result of search.
'A | B' as encapsulated information received through a POST boot of output devices connected.
'C | D' as encapsulated information received through a POST boot of output devices connected.
'facilities' as a root descriptor for a sensor network comprised of singular members working in unison [orchestration].
'see' in that based on feedback communication with sonic or optical sensors.
'forever' in that beyond the range of the sensor network.
'floating' in that it appears in a form that (logically) it should not.
(logically) in that it violates a law posited in the knowledge base.
